cupyint Documentation
===================================

**cupyint** is a CuPy-based library for numerical integration.  

**cupyint** is open-source, seen this `repository <https://github.com/ze-ouyang/cupyint>`_ in GitHub.

**cupyint** is jointly developed with `torchint <https://torchint-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and `numpyint <https://numpyint-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. These three packages are developed together using the same algorithm but are based on different Python packages. This is to provide high-performance integration operations both on CPU and GPU. Additionally, **torchint** is specifically designed for machine learning (preserving parameter gradients).
