cupyint Documentation
===================================

**cupyint** is a CuPy-based library for numerical integration.  

**cupyint** is open-source, seen in https://github.com/ze-ouyang/cupyint.

**cupyint** is jointly developed with **torchint** and **numpyint**. These three packages are developed together using the same algorithm but are based on different Python packages. This is to provide high-performance integration operations both on CPU and GPU. Additionally, **torchint** is specifically designed for machine learning (preserving parameter gradients).
