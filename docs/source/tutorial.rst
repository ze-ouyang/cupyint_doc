Overview
--------
**cupyint** is tailored to perform numerical integration based on `CuPy <https://cupy.dev/>`_, with highlighs in

1. high dimensional integration  
2. fast & parallel computation on GPU  
3. vectorized integration incorporating with broadcasting mechanism  
4. complicated integration boundaries  
5. tunable sampling points per dimension  
6. multiple integration methods, including deterministic & stochastic ones  
7. user-friendly interface  

In the following sections, theories and examples are provided with each integration method.

1. Trapezoidal integration  
2. Simpson's integration  
3. Boole's integration  
4. Gaussian quadrature  
5. Monte Carlo integration  
6. Importance sampling Monte Carlo integration
