Overview
--------
**cupyint** is tailored to perform numerical integration based on `CuPy <https://cupy.dev/>`_, with highlighs in

1. high dimensional integration  
2. fast & parallel computation on GPU  
2. vectorized integration incorporating with broadcasting mechanism
3. complicated integration boundaries
4. tunable sampling points per dimension
