Overview
--------
**cupyint** is tailored to perform numerical integration based on `CuPy <https://cupy.dev/>`_, with highlighs in

1. high dimensional integration  
2. fast & parallel computation on GPU  
3. vectorized integration incorporating with broadcasting mechanism  
4. complicated integration boundaries  
5. tunable sampling points per dimension  
6. user-friendly interface
